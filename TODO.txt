This file is where we will keep a high level list of tasks that need to be done.

Design:

Multi part system broken into 4 services
- Property Identifier
-- finds identifying information about properties of interest, such as addresses
-- saves that information in flat files

- Property Owner Identifier
-- reads property information from a flat file
-- mines multiple data sources
-- tries to find contact information for the owner of that property
-- creates the association between a property and an owner
-- saves the enriched property information in a flat file

- eMarketer
-- reads enriched property information from flat file
-- contacts property owners with a marketing message
-- tracks which messages have been sent to which owners
-- tracks performance of different marketing messages



Property Owner Identifier Tasks:
- create file reader
- create "main" method that will run the system, accept addresses (start with one address)
- create data classes for addresses, owners, and addresses with list of owners
- add generic data source (mls, county tax records, phone book, ect.)
- add specific data source
- add datasource rule
-- how to search that datasource for owner information
- add consolidator and aggregator (condence multiple records into one owner)
- save the enriched data in a flat file
-- connect to google drive
